# Microsoft Fabric - Data Factory in a Day

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to explore various data ingestion and transformation experiences. This includes the orchestration of end-to-end projects with [data pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/create-first-pipeline-with-sample-data) and an introduction to [dataflow gen2]() which represents the next generation of no-code/low-code data transformation that now support [data destinations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/dataflows-gen2-overview#data-destinations) and [fast copy](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/dataflows-gen2-fast-copy) data ingestion, which enhances the efficiency of data movement.

## Architecture

The process starts with a data pipeline that brings raw data into the Lakehouse Bronze layer, which stores the unprocessed information. This data is then cleaned and organized through another pipeline and moved into the Lakehouse Silver layer. From there, Dataflows Gen2, supported by Copilot, helps further transform the data to make it ready for analysis. The final, processed data is loaded into the Data Warehouse Gold layer using either Dataflows Gen2 or a copy job. This curated data is then used in Power BI for dashboards, reports, and business insights.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

1. **Data Pipeline:** Used for ingesting and moving data between different stages in the architecture. It automates the extraction, loading, and initial processing of data.

2. **Lakehouse (Bronze):** This is the first landing zone for raw data. It stores unprocessed or minimally processed data collected from various sources.

3. **Lakehouse (Silver):** The Silver layer contains data that has been cleaned, filtered, and structured. It serves as an intermediate stage, preparing data for advanced transformations.

4. **Dataflows Gen2:** A low-code/no-code transformation tool used to shape, enrich, and transform data from the Lakehouse. Integrated with **Copilot**, it allows users to build dataflows more intuitively and efficiently.

5. **Copy Job:** A tool or process used to transfer data from the Lakehouse Silver layer into the Data Warehouse Gold layer when needed.

6. **Data Warehouse (Gold):** The Gold layer is optimized for analytics. It stores fully transformed, business-ready data that supports reporting, dashboards, and decision-making.

7. **Power BI:** A business intelligence tool used to visualize and analyze data. It connects to the Data Warehouse to create interactive reports and dashboards for end users.
