# Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
**Source:** Microsoft Docs

Data Analysis Expressions¬†(DAX) is the native **formula** and¬†**query** language¬†for Tabular models in Analysis Services (SSAS/AAS), Power BI, and Power Pivot in Excel. DAX includes some of the functions that are used in¬†Excel¬†formulas with additional functions that are designed to work with¬†relational data¬†and perform dynamic¬†aggregation.

# Query Language

With DAX queries, you can query and return data defined by a table expression. Reporting clients construct DAX queries whenever a field is placed on a report surface, or a whenever a filter or calculation is applied. DAX queries can also be created and run in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and open-source tools like DAX Studio. DAX queries run in SSMS and DAX Studio return results as a table.

# Server Timings

## In-memory tabular query monitoring
Before considering how to monitor query performance for in-memory tabular models, it is important to first understand the query architecture for in-memory tabular models. Analysis Services processes queries for this model type by following these steps:

1. The Analysis Services query parser first evaluates whether the incoming request is a valid DAX or MDX query. (Tools like Excel or SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) can send MDX requests to a tabular model.)

2. If the query is an MDX query, Analysis Services invokes the MDX formula engine, which then sends a DAX request for measure calculations to the DAX formula engine. The MDX formula engine can request a measure embedded in the tabular model or request a calculation defined in the WITH clause of the MDX query. It can also request dimension from the VertiPaq storage engine. The MDX formula engine caches measures unless the MDX query contains a WITH clause.

3. The DAX formula engine receives either a DAX query request from the parser or a DAX request for measure calculations from the MDX formula engine. Either way, the DAX formula engine generates a query plan that it sends to the VertiPaq storage engine.

4. The VertiPaq storage engine processes the query plan received from the DAX formula engine. The storage engine is multi-threaded and scales well on multiple cores. It can scan large tables very efficiently and quickly. It can also evaluate simple mathematical operations, but pushes more complex operations back to the formula engine. If a calculation is **too complex**, it sends a **callback** to the formula engine.

5. The storage engine returns its results to the formula engine which compiles the data and returns the query results to the client application. It maintains a short-term VertiPaq cache to benefit multiple requests for the same data in the same query. An ancillary benefit is the availability of this data for subsequent queries for a period of time.

</br>

### Objective: Optimize the current DAX statement to remove the CallbackDataID and run performance benchmarks.

## Instructions

### DAX Studio
1. From the **Home** tab select **Server Timings**.

    - Optional: Select **Query Plan**

2. In the query Editor section enter the below query and review the output in the **Server Timings** section, after pressing the **Run** button.

```
EVALUATE
{ COUNTROWS ( FILTER ( Customer, NOT ISEMPTY ( RELATEDTABLE ( Sales ) ) ) ) }
```

![CallbackDataID](./Images/CallbackDataID.png)

3. Select the bolded Query to review the **xmSQL** statement to the right. The highlighted term **CallbackDataID** is returned if the expression is too complex, meaning a call back to the formula engine during the VertiPaq scan occurred.

4. In the query Editor section enter the below query and review the output in the **Server Timings** section, after pressing the **Run** button.

```
EVALUATE
{ COUNTROWS ( CALCULATETABLE ( Customer, Sales ) ) }
```

5. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab and with your query highlighted press the **Run Benchmark** button to test the performance of your query multiple times. Review the benchmark outputs of the query performance in both a cold and warm cache state.

# Dynamic Management Views

Analysis Services Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) are queries that return information about model objects, server operations, and server health. The query, based on SQL, is an interface to schema rowsets. Schema rowsets are predescribed tables that contain information about Analysis Services objects and server state, including database schema, active sessions, connections, commands, and jobs that are executing on the server.

#### **Query syntax**
The query engine for DMVs is the Data Mining parser. The DMV query syntax is based on the SELECT (DMX) statement. Although DMV query syntax is based on a SQL SELECT statement, it does not support the full syntax of a SELECT statement. Notably, JOIN, GROUP BY, LIKE, CAST, and CONVERT are not supported.

</br>

## Tabular Object Model Hierarchy

The Tabular Object Model (TOM) exposes native tabular metadata, such as model, tables, columns, and relationships objects.

From a logical perspective, all tabular objects form a tree, the root of which is a Model, descended from Database. Server and Database are not considered tabular because these objects can also represent a multidimensional database hosted on a server running in Multidimensional mode, or a tabular model at a lower compatibility level that does not use tabular metadata for object definitions.
