## Live Connection

A good practice for enterprise scale deployments is to separate dataset development from report and dashboard development. You can do this in Power BI Desktop by creating a separate PBIX file for each. For instance, you can upload a dataset PBIX file to the development stage and then connect it to a report PBIX file using a live connection. This way, different creators can work on modeling and visualizations independently. You can also apply this method across workspaces with shared datasets.

Learn more about [connecting to Power BI datasets](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-report-lifecycle-datasets).

## Page canvas and elements

A Power BI report page canvas is a single page that displays visualizations of your data. You can create and customize your report page canvas in Report view1 by adding fields, filters, and formatting options. You can also change the canvas settings to adjust the display ratio and size of your report page canvas.

We used PowerPoint to create a rich background for our Power BI report. We chose PowerPoint because it has design templates and shapes that match the slide dimensions of our report canvas. This way, we could plan our design elements before importing them into Power BI. All we had to do was size our visuals to fit the individual squares.

This technique can also improve the performance of our report by reducing the rendering times of having extra elements on our report page.

## Visualizations

Visualizations are ways of displaying data insights in Power BI reports. They can be charts, maps, tables, gauges, and many other types of graphics. You can create visualizations by selecting fields from your data model or by using Q&A. You can also customize your visualizations with different colors, shapes, filters, and interactions.

Learn more about [data visualizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-report-visualizations)

---

### Consolidating visuals

Our users want to see **Total Sales Amount**, **Total Items Discounted** and **Total Returned Items** at the top of our report. These are the key measures often used for their team discussion.

To optimize our report performance, we will use a single Table visual instead of three Card visuals. This will reduce the number of visuals on our canvas and save space.

---

1. Drag the **Table** visual from the **Visualizations** pane to the canvas and add the following measures to the table in this order:
    1. **Total Sales Amount**
    1. **Total Items Discounts**
    1. **Total Return Items**
    
    ![Table measures](./Media/TableMeasures.png)

1. Resize and position the table to fit the top horizontal section of our report.

![Table span](./Media/TableSpan.png)

1. To format our visual, go to the **Visualizations** pane and click on **Format your visual** to adjust these settings:

    **Note**: We can use the Search box to find specific settings quickly.

    | Section | **Column header** |
    | Border position | **Deselect any/all enabled options** |

    ![Grid border](./Media/GridBorder.png)

1. Next, we‚Äôll adjust the table columns and analyze the performance of our visual. To resize the columns, hover between them until you see the resize mouse icon. Then, drag them to align with the dividers on the canvas.

    ![Stretch columns](./Media/StretchColumns.png)

1. To check the performance of our table, go to the **View** tab and click on **Performance analyzer**. Then, click on **Start recording** and **Refresh** visuals. You can see the results for our table in the pane.
    1. To copy the query that was sent to our dataset, click on **Copy query** and paste it into a text editor.
    1. When you are done, click on **Stop** and minimize the **Performance analyzer** pane.

    ![Table analyzer](./Media/TableAnalyzer.png)

<font size="6">‚úÖ Lab check</font>

We have created a table visual that looks like three card visuals but uses only one query. This improves our report performance and makes it more appealing for our users. Reducing queries is important in Power BI.

### Slicers

Slicers are a type of visual that filters the other visuals on a report page. They let you select values from a field and see how they affect your data. You can use slicers to create customized charts and reports that show only the information you want3.

There are different types of slicers in Power BI, such as relative date slicer, numeric range slicer, dropdown slicer, etc. You can add slicers from the Visualizations pane and sync them across multiple pages.

Learn more about [slicers](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-slicers?tabs=powerbi-desktop)

---

1. Drag the **Slicer** visual from the **Visualizations** pane to the canvas below the **Total Sales Amount** column. Add the **DateKey** field from the **Calendar** table to the slicer and then click on the downward chevron (**V**) on the top right of the slicer and change it from **Between** to **Relative Date**.

    ![Relative date](./Media/RelativeDate.png)

1. Set the slicer value to **Last 18 Months**. This will filter our data for the past 18 months and update automatically every day.

    ![Last 18 months](./Media/Last18Months.png)

1. To format our slicer, go to the **Visualizations** pane and click on **Format your visual**. Then, adjust these settings:

    **Note**: We can use the Search box to find specific settings quickly.

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Header** |
    | Slicer header > Title text | **Date** |
    | Slicer header > Font | **Segoe UI Semibold** |
    | Slicer header > Font size | **9** |
    | Slicer header > Background | **White, 10% darker** |

    ![Style none](./Media/SlicerHeader.png)

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Background** |
    | Values > Background > Background color | **White** |
    | Effects > Background | **Off** |

    ![Style none](./Media/BackgroundColors.png)

1. Add a **Slicer** visual from the **Visualizations** pane below the **Total Items Discounted** column. Add the **ProductCategoryName** and **ProductSubcategoryName** fields from the **Products** table to the slicer.

    ![Products slicer](./Media/ProductsSlicer.png)

1. To check how this slicer affects the performance of your report, go to the **View** tab and click on **Performance analyzer**. Then, click on **Start recording** and hover over the slicer. We will see an **Analyze this visual** button on the top right. Click on it and expand the Slicer name in the pane. We will see a **DAX query** that was sent to display the values in the slicer.

    ![Analyze products slicer](./Media/AnalyzerProductsSlicer.png)

1. To improve our report performance, we'll change our slicer from a list to a dropdown. Click on the downward chevron (**V**) on the top right of the slicer and select **Dropdown**. This will reduce the number of queries sent to your dataset.

    ![Slicer dropdown](./Media/SlicerDropDown.png)

1. To verify this improvement, hover over the slicer again and click on **Analyze this visual**. We will notice that there is no longer a **DAX query** under the Slicer name when it is collapsed. The query will only run when you click on the slicer to see its values.

    ![Slicer dropdown analyzer](./Media/SlicerDropDownAnalyzer.png)

1. From the **Visualizations** pane add a **Slicer** visual below the **Total Returned Items** column. Insert the **CustomerType** field from the **Customer** table either into the **Field** value in the **Visualizations** pane or the slicer itself and in the top right of the slicer select the downward chevron **(V)** and change the value to **Dropdown**.

    ![Customer slicer](./Media/CustomerSlicer.png)

1. To transfer visual configurations, select the **Date** slicer and then navigate to the **Home** tab to select the **Format painter** button. Repeat the following steps for the other two slicers.
    1. Paste to the **ProductCategoryName, ProductSubcategoryName** slicer.
    1. Paste to the **CustomerType** slicer.
    
    ![Format painter](./Media/FormatPainter.png)

1. We'll now click and hold the left mouse click and select both the **ProductCategoryName, ProductSubcategoryName** and **CustomerType** slicers (or press and hold Ctrl and then Click) on our page, navigate to the **Visualizations** pane's **Format your visual** section and update the following configurations below.

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Background** |
    | Values > Background > Color | **White** |

    ![Slicers values background](./Media/SlicersValuesBackground.png)

![Finished slicer](./Media/FinishedSlicer.png)

Maintaining a consistent look across report elements ensures a professional experience for end users. Utilizing features like **Format painter** (found across Office applications) or by bulk updating configurations is quick way to ensure our configurations are consistent.

### Natural language

Q&A in Power BI is a feature that lets you explore your data using natural language. You can type questions in the Q&A box and get answers in the form of visuals. You can also use Q&A to create visuals for your reports by asking questions about your data. Q&A recognizes the words you type and figures out where and how to find the answer.

    ![Rename sparkline](./Media/ResizeSparkline.png)

### Drill-through

Drillthrough is a feature in Power BI that lets you create a target page in your report that focuses on a specific entity, such as a supplier, customer, or manufacturer1. You can then right-click on a data point in another page and drill through to the target page to see details that are filtered to that context. To set up drillthrough, you need to create a target page with the visuals you want and add fields to the Drillthrough filter well. You can also customize your back button image and pass all filters in drillthrough.

    ![Resize matrix](./Media/ResizeMatrix.png)

## Artificial Intelligence

Power BI has AI visuals such as Key Influencers, Decomposition Tree, and Anomaly Detection. They can help us optimize our business metrics by finding out what factors affect them.

### Anomaly detection

1. We want to show how our total sales amount changed over time using a line chart. To do this, we need to follow these steps:
    1. Go to the **Visualizations** pane and select a **Line** visual, dragging it to the bottom left rectangle on our canvas.
    1. Add **DateKey** field from the **Calendar** table as our **X-axis**
    1. Add **Total Sales Amount** measure as Y-axis

    ![Total sales amount line chart](./Media/TotalSalesAmountLine.png)    

    1. Enable anomaly detection under **Add further analyses to your visual**

    **Note**: We can use the Search box to find specific settings quickly.

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Anomalies** |
    | Find anomalies | **On** |

    ![Find anomalies](./Media/FindAnomalies.png)

1. Now we have a line chart that shows us unusual patterns in our sales data. We can click on any anomaly marker to see more details on a new **Anomalies** pane. This pane tells us why an anomaly was detected and possible explanations for it. Our end users can also access this feature when they view our reports on Power BI service (cloud).

    ![Anomalies pane](./Media/AnomaliesPane.png)

### Q&A visual

1. Last, we want to add a **Q&A** visual that allows our end users to ask their own questions and find new insights. To do this, we need to follow these steps:
    1. Double click on the bottom right rectangle on our canvas
    1. A **Q&A** visual will appear where we can type our questions
    1. The Q&A visual will show us relevant answers using our data

1. For our last visual we'll now add the **Q&A** visual to the bottom right rectangle on our canvas by simply double clicking.

    With including the **Q&A** visual, we can provide our end users the ability to find new insights by typing their own questions, for scenarios that we may not have even thought to visualize yet.
