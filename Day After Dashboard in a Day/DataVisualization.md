# Data Visualization

✏️ Lab scenario
---

For this portion of the lab, we've been tasked with creating a Power BI report to unlock new insights for our users. The interactivity of our report should be both **functional** and **fast** to ensure a pleasant viewing experience for our users.

# Report design

The content throughout this lab utilizes the proven design processes created by leading report design experts. These processes encompasses the phases of understanding the report users and their requirements, exploring pleasing report designs, and developing reports all the way into production.

## Live Connection

For enterprise scale deployments, it's recommended to separate dataset development, and the development of reports and dashboards.

This approach should start from Power BI Desktop, by creating a separate PBIX file for datasets and reports. For example, you can create a dataset PBIX file and uploaded it to the development stage. Later, your report authors can create a new PBIX only for the report, and connect it to the published dataset using a live connection. This technique allows different creators to separately work on modeling and visualizations.

With shared datasets, you can also use this method across workspaces.

1. We'll start by creating a new Power BI file by selecting the **File** and **New** option (shortcut **Ctrl+N**) if Power BI Desktop is currently open.
    1. If Power BI Desktop is not currently open, a new application instance will automatically create a new file upon opening.

1. From the **Home** tab, we'll select the **Data hub** option and then **Power BI datasets** to create a new live connection to an existing dataset.
