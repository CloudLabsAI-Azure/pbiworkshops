# Data Visualization

‚úèÔ∏è Lab scenario
---

For this portion of the lab, we've been tasked with creating a Power BI report to unlock new insights for our users. The interactivity of our report should be both **functional** and **fast** to ensure a pleasant viewing experience for our users, while adhering to the professional look and brand standards of our company.

# Report design

The content throughout this lab utilizes the proven design processes created by leading report design experts. These processes encompasses the phases of understanding the report users and their requirements, exploring pleasing report designs, and developing reports all the way into production.

## Live Connection

For enterprise scale deployments, it's recommended to separate dataset development, and the development of reports and dashboards.

This approach should start from Power BI Desktop, by creating a separate PBIX file for datasets and reports. For example, you can create a dataset PBIX file and uploaded it to the development stage. Later, your report authors can create a new PBIX only for the report, and connect it to the published dataset using a live connection. This technique allows different creators to separately work on modeling and visualizations.

With shared datasets, you can also use this method across workspaces.

By leveraging PowerPoint, their design templates and shapes we were able to create a rich background that we could easily import into Power BI as the slide dimensions are the same as our report canvas. In leveraging this method we can lay out our design elements before hand to make Power BI as straight forward as sizing our visuals to the individual squares.

This technique also reduces the rendering times of having additional elements on our report page, increasing the overall performance of our report.

### Consolidating visuals

We've been asked by our users to ensure the **Total Sales Amount**, **Total Items Discounted** and **Total Returned Items** measures are prominently displayed at the top of our report as these results will be the most common discussion points.

As more requirements continue to be added to our report design, we want to be cognizant of the number of visuals we are including on our canvas, so we'll leverage a technique below to consolidate a more common design pattern of three **Card** visuals into a more optimized approach with a single **Table** to optimize our report performance.

---

1. From the **Visualizations** pane add a **Table** visual and insert the below measures in the following order.
    1. **Total Sales Amount**
    1. **Total Items Discounts**
    1. **Total Return Items**
    
    ![Table measures](./Media/TableMeasures.png)

1. We'll position our table to be the same size and width that spans our top horizontal section and place this visual within this section.

![Table span](./Media/TableSpan.png)

1. Utilizing the **Visualizations** pane's **Format your visual** section, we'll update the following configurations below.

    **Note**: Utilize the Search box, to easily discover configurable settings.

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Style** |
    | Style presets | **None** |

    ![Style none](./Media/StyleNone.png)

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Effects** |
    | Effects > Background | **Off** |

    ![Effects off](./Media/EffectsOff.png)

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Headers** |
    | Column headers > Font  | **Segoe UI Semibold** |
    | Column headers > Font size  | **12** |
    | Column headers > Text color | **#118DFF** |
    | Column headers > Header alignment | **Center** |
    | Column headers > Text wrap | **Off** |

    ![Column headers](./Media/ColumnHeaders.png)

    <i>If the text color isn't within your default selection, select <b>More colors...</b> to enter the code manually.</i>
    
    ![Text color](./Media/TextColor.png)

                

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Values** |
    | Values > Font  | **Segoe UI Semibold** |
    | Values > Font size  | **16** |

    ![Values font](./Media/ValuesFont.png)

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Column** |
    | Specific column > Series  | **For each value in the drop down list, update the alignment below** |
    | Specific column > Alignment  | **Center** |

    ![Specific column](./Media/SpecificColumn.png)

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Border** |
    | Grid | **Border** |
    | Section | **Column header** |
    | Border position | **Deselect any/all enabled options** |

    ![Grid border](./Media/GridBorder.png)

1. Now that we've customized our table visualization to meet the aesthetic of our brand standards, we'll re-size the current columns by hovering between each column until the resize mouse icon appears and we'll align each of our columns with the current dividers in the canvas background.

    ![Stretch columns](./Media/StretchColumns.png)

1. We'll now navigate to our **View** tab and select the **Performance analyzer** option. Within the **Performance analyzer** pane we'll select **Start recording** and then **Refresh visuals** where we can review the results for our **Table**. 
    1. To view the fused query, select the **Copy query** option and paste into a text editor.
    1. Once complete, select the **Stop** option and minimize the **Performance analyzer** pane.

    ![Table analyzer](./Media/TableAnalyzer.png)

Using the above technique we were able to emulate the presentation of three individual card visuals, in the form of a single table - while still preserving an aesthetically pleasing presentation for our users. In Power BI, its important to reduce the amount of queries sent to our dataset to improve our report performance.

### Slicers

---

1. From the **Visualizations** pane add a **Slicer** visual below the **Total Sales Amount** column. Insert the **DateKey** field from the **Calendar** table either into the **Field** value in the **Visualizations** pane or drop directly on the slicer itself and update the following configuration below.
    1. In the top right of the date visual select the downward chevron (**V**) and change the current slicer from **Between** to **Relative Date**.

    ![Relative date](./Media/RelativeDate.png)

1. Update the slicer values to **Last 18 Months** to create a rolling 18 month selection. This filter now will automatically apply as each new day occurs.

    ![Last 18 months](./Media/Last18Months.png)

1. Utilizing the **Visualizations** pane's **Format your visual** section, we'll update the following configurations below to our slicer.

    **Note**: Utilize the Search box, to easily discover configurable settings.

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Header** |
    | Slicer header > Font | **Segoe UI Semibold** |
    | Slicer header > Font size | **9** |
    | Slicer header > Background | **White, 10% darker** | 

    ![Style none](./Media/SlicerHeader.png)

    | | |
    | :- | :- |
    | üîç Search term | **Background** |
    | Values > Background | **White** |
    | Effects > Background | **Off** |

    ![Style none](./Media/BackgroundColors.png)

1. From the **Visualizations** pane add a **Slicer** visual below the **Total Items Discounted** column. Insert the **ProductCategoryName** field first and the **ProductSubcategoryName** second from the **Products** table either into the **Field** value in the **Visualizations** pane or drop directly on the slicer itself.

    ![Products slicer](./Media/ProductsSlicer.png)

1. We'll now navigate to the **View** tab and select the **Performance analyzer** option. Within the **Performance analyzer** pane we'll select **Start recording** and then hover above our current slicer and select the **Analyze this visual** button in the top right.
    
    Within our results, if we expand the **Slicer** name, a **DAX query** is present - this is because to render the current **List** configuration it must send a query to display our values.

    ![Analyze products slicer](./Media/AnalyzerProductsSlicer.png)

1. To increase our reports performance, we'll select the downward chevron **(V)** in the top right of our slicer and change the value to **Dropdown**

    ![Slicer dropdown](./Media/SlicerDropDown.png)

1. Hovering above our current slicer once again, we'll select the **Analyze this visual** button in the top right and review the updated results within the **Performance analyzer** pane where the **Slicer** no longer contains a **DAX query** when collapsed, it will only be when a user selects the slicer that it will then run a query to return our list of values.
