# Day After Dashboard in a Day

## Introduction
In the Day After Dashboard in a Day you will learn about various advanced analytic features of Power BI, such as [composite models](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-composite-models), [dataflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-introduction-self-service), [query folding](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-query/power-query-folding), designing stunning reports and more.

This course assumes that you have a working knowledge of report authoring using Power BI Desktop and content sharing via the Power BI service.

### Prerequisites
The content in this lab requires access to a **Power BI Premium** workspace within the Power BI service.
- Premium Per User
- or a Premium capacity subscription

For additional system requirements, see [prerequisites for the lab](./Prerequisites.md)

## Data Preparation

In this lab you'll learn about how to shape data using Power Query Online.

1. How to create a [dataflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-introduction-self-service) to prepare and load data using Power Query Online.
1. How to write custom functions using the [Power Query M formula language](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerquery-m/).
1. How to ensure [query folding](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-query/power-query-folding) is occurring when transforming data.

## Data Modeling

In this lab you'll learn how to create datasets optimized for performance and usability using Power BI Desktop.

1. How to configure different [Storage Modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-storage-mode) and how to properly model your [data](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/guidance/star-schema) using Power BI Desktop.

    Storage modes:
    1. [DirectQuery](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-directquery-about#directquery-connections)
    1. [Mixed](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-composite-models)
    1. [Import](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-directquery-about#import-connections)
1. How to use the [Performance analyzer](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-performance-analyzer) to examine report performance.
1. How to use [External Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools) for professional development.
